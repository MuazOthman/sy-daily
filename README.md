## Architecture

### AWS Lambda (Production) - 5-Stage Modular Pipeline

The system uses a modular pipeline where each stage is a separate Lambda function, orchestrated via S3 and EventBridge:

**Stage 1: Collection**
- **CollectFunction**: Collects raw news posts from Telegram channels
  - Scheduled execution at 20:01 UTC daily (23:01 Damascus time)
  - Entry point: `src/lambda/Collect.ts`
  - Timeout: 10 minutes for web scraping
  - Memory: 1GB, ARM64 architecture
  - State tracking: Initializes briefing in DynamoDB and records collection timestamp
  - Output: `collected-news/{date}.json` â†’ S3

**Stage 2: Early Deduplication**
- **DeduplicateFunction**: AI-powered early deduplication with multi-round processing
  - Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event from Stage 1
  - Entry point: `src/lambda/Deduplicate.ts`
  - Timeout: 15 minutes for multi-round AI processing
  - Memory: 1GB, ARM64 architecture
  - State tracking: Validates briefing hasn't been deduplicated, records deduplication timestamp
  - Uses 150-item batches with round-robin redistribution between rounds
  - Processes up to 5 parallel requests per batch group
  - Output: `deduplicated-news/{date}.json` â†’ S3

**Stage 3: Summarization**
- **SummarizeFunction**: AI-powered summarization and translation
  - Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event from Stage 2
  - Entry point: `src/lambda/Summarize.ts`
  - Timeout: 10 minutes for AI processing
  - Memory: 512MB, ARM64 architecture
  - State tracking: Validates briefing hasn't been summarized, records summarization timestamp
  - Output: `summarized-news/{date}.json` â†’ S3

**Stage 4: Website Publishing**
- **PublishToWebsiteFunction**: Publishes news to GitHub Pages website
  - Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event from Stage 3
  - Entry point: `src/lambda/PublishToWebsite.ts`
  - Timeout: 1 minute for GitHub API operations
  - Memory: 256MB, ARM64 architecture
  - State tracking: Validates briefing hasn't been published, records publishing timestamp
  - Triggers custom EventBridge event (`summaries-published`) after publishing

**Stage 5: Telegram Posting**
- **PostToTelegramEnglishFunction & PostToTelegramArabicFunction**: Post formatted news with banners
  - Triggered by custom EventBridge event from Stage 4 (same trigger for both)
  - Entry point: `src/lambda/PostToTelegram.ts`
  - Timeout: 1 minute for posting
  - Memory: 512MB, ARM64 architecture with font rendering layers
  - State tracking: Validates briefing hasn't been posted for this language, records post URL
  - Fetches pre-composed banners from S3 and adds date overlay

### Local Development

- Direct execution that runs pipeline stages locally for testing
- Entry point: `src/local/index.ts`
- Tests both English and Arabic output in a single run
- Uses dotenv for environment variables
- Local caching system via `cache/` directory to avoid re-fetching and re-processing during development
- Local pipeline: Collect â†’ Deduplicate â†’ Summarize â†’ Format â†’ (Optionally) Post

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x
- Yarn
- Git
- A way to tunnel your local server to the internet (e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/))
- A testing Telegram channel to post the summaries to (you can use the same channel for both languages)
- A Telegram bot token (you can get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- An AI API key (e.g. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) or [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sy-daily.git
cd sy-daily

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

**Required Credentials**:

- **Telegram Bot Token**: Get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- **Telegram API Credentials**: Get from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
- **Session String**: Generated when you first run the app with valid API credentials. You leave it blank in local development for the first time you run the app, but make sure to temporarily disable the check in the `src/telegram/user.ts` file.
- **AI API Key**: Either OpenAI or Anthropic API key for content processing
- **Channel IDs**: Telegram channel IDs where you want to post the summaries

### Running Locally

1. **Create environment file**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

```env
DEV_PUBLIC_SERVER=your_public_server_url
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash
SESSION_STRING=your_session_string

# AI Provider Configuration (choose one or both)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
AI_MODEL=openai:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
# Alternative: AI_MODEL=anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Telegram Channel Configuration
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID_ENGLISH=your_english_channel_id
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID_ARABIC=your_arabic_channel_id
```

1. **Create or identify your Telegram channel IDs**:

You can find your channel ID (typically a negative number) by starting the Telegram bot in your local environment

```bash
yarn run telegram:serve
```

then register the webhook

```bash
yarn run telegram:register-webhook
```

Note: you need to have a way to tunnel your local server to the internet (e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)), that you need to set in the `DEV_PUBLIC_SERVER` environment variable.

Once the webhook is registered, you can send a message to the channel and see the channel ID in the console output.

3. **Run the bot locally**:

```bash
# Start the news collection and posting process
yarn start

# This will:
# 1. Collect news from 30+ configured Telegram channels
# 2. Process and summarize the content using AI
# 3. Generate banner images for both languages
# 4. Post formatted summaries to your configured channels
```

Notes:

- The first time you run the app, it will persist the cache in the `cache/cachedData.json` file. This will be used to skip the collection and summarization process the next time you run the app, and will speed up the process and save on the AI credits. You can delete the file to start fresh.
- The first time you run the app, it will interactively ask you to enter your Telegram user credentials to acquire a session string. You can subsequently use the `SESSION_STRING` environment variable to avoid this step. Make sure to temporarily disable the check in the `src/telegram/user.ts` file and set the `SESSION_STRING` environment variable then re-enable the check.

## How It Works

### 5-Stage Pipeline Flow (Production)

**Stage 1: CollectFunction** (Scheduled at 20:01 UTC daily)
1. **State Initialization**: Creates briefing record in DynamoDB
2. **Collection**: Uses Telegram API to fetch posts from 30+ configured channels in the last 24 hours (Damascus time)
3. **Processing**: Extracts article content from linked URLs using axios and JSDOM
4. **Storage**: Uploads raw collected posts to S3 at `collected-news/{date}.json`
5. **State Update**: Records collection completion timestamp in DynamoDB

**Stage 2: DeduplicateFunction** (Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event)
6. **State Validation**: Checks briefing exists and hasn't been deduplicated
7. **Retrieval**: Downloads raw collected posts from S3
8. **Multi-Round Deduplication**: Implements AI-powered deduplication with round-robin redistribution
   - Splits items into batches of 150 items
   - Processes up to 5 batches in parallel per round
   - Redistributes items using round-robin between rounds to maximize deduplication opportunities
   - Continues until 98% ratio threshold is reached or max rounds completed
9. **Storage**: Uploads deduplicated posts to S3 at `deduplicated-news/{date}.json`
10. **State Update**: Records deduplication completion timestamp in DynamoDB

**Stage 3: SummarizeFunction** (Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event)
11. **State Validation**: Checks briefing exists and hasn't been summarized
12. **Retrieval**: Downloads deduplicated posts from S3
13. **Batch Processing**: Splits posts into batches of 20 items each
14. **Parallel Summarization**: Processes up to 30 batches in parallel using AI
15. **Translation**: Creates English summaries and translations from Arabic content
16. **Storage**: Uploads summarized data to S3 at `summarized-news/{date}.json`
17. **State Update**: Records summarization completion timestamp in DynamoDB

**Stage 4: PublishToWebsiteFunction** (Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated event)
18. **State Validation**: Checks briefing exists and hasn't been published to website
19. **Retrieval**: Downloads summarized news from S3
20. **GitHub Publishing**: Publishes content to GitHub repository for website deployment
21. **State Update**: Records website publishing completion timestamp in DynamoDB
22. **Event Notification**: Triggers custom EventBridge event (`summaries-published`) to notify Telegram functions

**Stage 5: PostToTelegramFunction** (Both English and Arabic triggered by custom EventBridge event)
23. **State Validation**: Checks briefing exists and hasn't been posted for this language
24. **Retrieval**: Downloads summarized news from S3
25. **Final Prioritization**: Analyzes and prioritizes news items using weighted label system
26. **Formatting**: Formats news items into structured Telegram messages (language-specific with HTML formatting)
27. **Banner Selection**: Determines most frequent news category and fetches pre-composed banner from S3
28. **Date Overlay**: Adds date overlay to banner image
29. **Publishing**: Posts banner image with formatted summary to respective target Telegram channels via TelegramUser client
30. **State Update**: Records Telegram post URL in DynamoDB

### Local Development Flow

- Executes pipeline stages locally via `src/local/index.ts`
- Local pipeline: Collect â†’ Deduplicate â†’ Summarize â†’ Format â†’ (Optionally) Post
- Tests both English and Arabic output
- Uses local caching system to avoid re-fetching and re-processing during development
